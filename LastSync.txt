    ipq40xx: fix openmesh sysupgrade with tar content out of order
    
    The tar extraction depends on the order in which the files
    are added to the tar file. Since the order is not guaranteed
    and depends on the host system, the combined mtd write fails
    with sysupgrade images built on some systems.
    Fix by changing to tar file order independent mtd write.
